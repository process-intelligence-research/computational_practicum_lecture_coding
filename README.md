# Computational_Practicum_Lecture_Coding

Welcome to the Lecture Examples repository! This repository contains Python code files used as examples during my lectures. Each lecture is organized into a separate folder for easy navigation and reference.

2. [Q1 Lecture 2: Linear algebra, eigenvectors, linear systems](/q1_lecture_2/)
3. [Q1 Lecture 3: Nonlinear equation systems](/q1_lecture_3/)
4. [Q1 Lecture 4: Integration, errors, differentiation](/q1_lecture_4/)
5. [Q1 Lecture 5: Ordinary differential equations, initial value problems, forward Euler, backward Euler](/q1_lecture_5/)
6. [Q1 Lecture 6: Boundary value problem, finite difference method](/q1_lecture_6/)
7. [Q1 Lecture 7: Boundary value problem, shooting method](/q1_lecture_7/)
8. [Q2 Lecture 1: Advanced programming](/q2_lecture_1/)
9. [Q2 Lecture 2: Partial differential equations, finite difference method](/q2_lecture_2/)
10. [Q2 Lecture 3: Partial differential equations in multiple space dimensions and time](/q2_lecture_3/)
11. [Q2 Lecture 4: Optimization 1](/q2_lecture_4/)
12. [Q2 Lecture 5: Optimization 2](/q2_lecture_5/)
13. [Q2 Lecture 6: Regression, interpolation, least squares](/q2_lecture_6/)
<!-- 14. [Q2 Lecture 7: ](/q2_lecture_7/) -->
## Folder Structure

Each lecture is organized into a separate folder with a meaningful name to help you quickly find the relevant code examples. Inside each folder, you'll find Python code files (.ipynb) and any additional resources or documentation related to the lecture.

   ```
lecture_1/
├── example1.ipynb
├── example2.ipynb
├── ...
├── README.md (Optional: Additional information about Lecture 1)
```

## Run code online
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/process-intelligence-research/computational_practicum_lecture_coding/main)
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/process-intelligence-research/computational_practicum_lecture_coding/blob/main)

You can also run the code online via [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or  Google's [Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/). Binder is a free, open-source web service that packages Jupyter notebooks inside an executable container, which can be run within a web browser, no installation required. 
Colab allows users with Google accounts to execute Jupyter notebooks on the Google cloud. 

**To execute the notebook in Binder:**
1. Click the `launch binder` button above. Once the demo launches, click `My_sample_notebook.ipynb` in the file listing.
2. Run the notebook by selecting `Cell > Run All`.

**To execute the notebook in Colab:**
1. Click the `Open in Colab` button above. It will launch the notebook directly.
2. Navigate to the lecture folder you are interested in and open the notebook you are interested in.
3. Make the notebook live by clicking 'Connect' in the Colab toolbar. 
4. Select `Runtime > Run All` in the menu to execute the notebook. (You may get a warning that the page was not authored by Google.) 

## Getting Started and run code locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lecture-examples.git


2. Navigate to the specific lecture folder you are interested in.

3. Explore the Python code files provided as examples during the lecture.
